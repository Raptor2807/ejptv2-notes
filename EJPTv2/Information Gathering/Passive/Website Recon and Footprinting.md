### what are we looking for?
- IP addresses
- directories hidden from search engines
- Names
- Email addrs
- Phone numbers
- Physical addrs
- Web Technologies being used

### Practical 
- whatis - command used for knowing what a command does
- host - DNS lookup utility
	- whenever we use host command and we get more than one ip we should know from that point that we are dealing with some form of proxy.
	- Googlepixel@2025
- robots.txt - best place to start
	- it is a text file that contains information for search engine crawlers. 
		- but when search engines do this they could potentially reveal information which u don't want to be public -> this is where robots.txt file plays an imp role
	- it basically allows you to specify what folders or what files you don't want search engines to index
		- here when we check robots.txt file for hackersploit.org we can see *disallow* which means search engines aren't allowed to index that directory or file
	- when we see the directory names like wp-admin or something with wp -> the website uses wordpress
- sitemap.xml / sitemaps.xml
	- it is essentially a file that is used to provide search engines with an organized way of indexing the website
	- we can use this to find if there is a page which is publicly accessible but not indexed or referenced by the frontend of the website
	- when we are dealing with a wordpress website, always lookout for categories as there could be some categories which are hidden on the frontend
- ##### Browser plugins (firefox)
	- *BuiltWith* - it is a website profiler tool. upon looking up a page it returns all the technologies in use on that page that it can find.
		- it tells us what plugins or what widgets are used on the website
		- it also reveals all the subdomains linked to the target website
	- *Wappalyzer* - same as builtwith
	- *WhatWeb* - it is a pre-packaged tool with kali
		- it is also a website scanner.
		- it has two modes 
			- _Stealthy_ - Makes one HTTP request per target and also follows redirects
			- _Aggressive_ - if a level 1 plugin is matched, additional requests will be made 
		- when we use this command if it tells [301-Moved permanently] it means there is a redirection which is happening.
	- *HTTrack* - it allows you to download recursively all directories, getting HTML, and other files from the server to your computer
		- we can use this to analyze the source code of a website and checking it locally 
		- installed in kale go to start and search webhttrack and it will open on local server 
		- This tool might not work when the website uses proxy
