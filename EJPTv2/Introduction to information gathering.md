- reconnaissance = Information Gathering
- It is the first step of Pen testing 
- Involves gathering or collecting information about an individual - getting understanding about what we are targeting
- More information = more chances of a successful pen attack
- Typically broken into two types
	- Passive - utilizing publicly available information
	- Active - actively engaging with the target system, for ex: port scanning with nmap to identify active services on the target system and use that to identify the vulnerabilities and using them to penetrate
		- you need an authorization for this type of information gathering - Illegal
