- Using wireshark we can capture the packets while we do nmap scan
	- Response to a SYN ping
		- SYNACK : Open port
			- in response nmap sends an RSt to terminate the connection
		- RST : Closed port
		- NO response : packet might be filtered by firewall and potentially dropped. 
			- hence, can't say for sure if the port is open or not
